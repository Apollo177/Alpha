# Alpha
Project Alpha Repository

This is a repository for the files containing my bery first Terraform/AWS project - I will include all files used.
This project was aided by FreeCodeCamp's tutorial but I added many aspects to it, and because it is my first project, it likely has a lot of inefficiency but I hope one day I can look at this in the future and see how long I've come. the basic outline for this project are as follows:

Project Aplha Outline
    1) Create VPC
    2) Create Internet Gateway
    3) Create Custom Route Table
    4) Create Subnet
    5) Associate Subnet with Route Table
    6) Create Security Group to allow ports: 22, 80, 443
    7) Assign ENI with EIP 
    8) Assign Elastic IP to ENI
    9) Creat IAM Role to acces S3
    10) Create Linux Server and Install/Enable Apache2
    11) Enable VCP Endpoint

The only thing that was completed through the portal and note in the "Alpha.tf" file was the creation and upload of my AWS bucket. The site is currently down and not routable, but I had a lot of fun with this test environment.
